// Identifying if a number is prime in an array, return prime numbers - JEAN
/*  1. Create an array that consist of numbers.
    2. Create a function that will take a single parameter. Inside the function create a for loop
        that starts in 2 up to the square root of the number 
    3. Check if the number is divisible by the loop, if it is divisible it will return because the number is not prime.
    4. If the loop has not found divisible, return true because it is a prime number.
    5. Create another function, inside the function create an empty array. 
    6. Used for loop to iterate each number.
    7. Call the first function. If the number is prime it will add to the empty array.
    8. Return the array.
    9. Print the result.

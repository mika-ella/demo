// Identifying if a number is prime in an array, return prime numbers - JEAN
/*  1. Create an array that consist of numbers.
    2. Create a function that takes a single parameter.
    3. Use loop to check if the number is divisible in any number from to current number.
        If it is, return false because it is not a prime number.
        If it is not, return true because it is a prime number.
    4. Create another function that takes an array of numbers, within function create an empty array. 
    5. Used loop to iterate each number.
    6. Call the first function.
    7.If the number is prime it will add to the empty array.
    8. Print the result.

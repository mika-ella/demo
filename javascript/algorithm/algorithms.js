/*
    1. Assume that there is an array of integers called 'numbers'
    2. Create a variable with type array, name it 'evenNumbers'
    3. Iterate the array 'numbers'
        3a. Every iteration, check if the number is divisible 2
        3b. If the number is divisible by 2, add the number to 'evenNumbers' array
        3c. If the number is NOT divisible by 2, ignore the number and move onto the next iteration
